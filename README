Nothing to see here, just learning to go.

If, for whatever reason, you want to build, you should just type make.  If, once you've made, and you decide to install, you are an idiot.  But you can just type make install.  It will probably put it somewhere like $GOROOT/bin or $HOME/bin if you have a typical go installation.

Mostly what I'm interested in is making something that is vaguely shell-ish, except not optimized for calling other executables, not dependent upon other programs in /usr/bin etc., somewhat parallel, and generally self aware.
